                    <p class="text-gray-800">
                        Established in December 2023 by Co-Founders who shared a commitment to supporting families in
                        and around Tyneside, Tyneside Community Store C.I.C. has rapidly expanded with the help of
                        dedicated Directors, volunteers, and a supportive community. Tyneside Community Store C.I.C. has
                        played a crucial role in providing essential items to thousands of families, ensuring the
                        well-being, growth, and development of their young ones.

                        Operating on a referral and walk-in basis to our community shop in Wallsend, we receive
                        referrals from professionals directly assisting families. Actively seeking donations of
                        pre-loved items, we not only address immediate needs but also contribute to reducing landfill
                        waste and fostering sustainability. Additionally, we run a successful volunteer program for the
                        local community and offer placement opportunities for colleges, universities, and businesses.

                        contact us is via email or Facebook. Please understand that we operate part-time, and our social
                        media channels are managed by volunteers juggling this responsibility with work and family
                        commitments, so your patience is appreciated.

                        Tyneside Community Store C.I.C. was founded in response to the pressing issue of poverty in
                        Tyneside, with over 35% of people estimated to be in relative poverty after housing costs.
                        Approximately 190,000 children are thought to be living in poverty in Tyneside according to the
                        North East Child Poverty Commission report 2021/22, figures may even underestimate the true
                        number of children facing poverty.

                    <p class="text-gray-800">
                        Children in poverty are more likely to encounter challenges in their day-to-day lives and future
                        prospects. There are strong correlations between childhood poverty and poorer mental and
                        physical health, shorter life expectancy, lower educational attainment, and lower-paying
                        insecure work.

                        Tyneside Community Store C.I.C. is committed to ensuring every child can thrive and develop as
                        they should, providing safe places to sleep, sufficient food, and toys for proper growth and
                        development. While the existence of baby banks and community stores may not be ideal, as long as
                        there are children in poverty in our county, we are dedicated to doing everything within our
                        capacity to support struggling families – families just like ours.
